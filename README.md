Work Planner Project - Created by Mitchell Vandermolen, Code Audit done by Matt C.

Created using HTML, CSS, JS, moment.js

Lovingly crafted with several moments of headdesking and realizing I am very good at making spaghetti

Started with a basic HTML layout and CSS styling to fit the aesthetic I was looking for. As well as setting up the references for JS and Fonts.

Wrote the first iteration of the JS code and after several hours of debugging and looking up new methods of doing loops was able to shrink my code from 260 lines to 60 lines.
